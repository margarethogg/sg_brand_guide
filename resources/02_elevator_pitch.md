# ELEVATOR PITCH<!-- (clients) -->
Shiftgig is the smartest and easiest way for the hourly workforce and businesses to connect. We're a mobile marketplace that fully vets and background checks workers, which we call Specialists, who can then pick up shifts on our mobile app and work when, where, and for whom they want. Our clients love our platform because they can manage their temporary labor directly from the Shiftgig Business app. We're currently working with the biggest brands in the food service, hospitality, retail, warehouse and experiential marketing industries.
