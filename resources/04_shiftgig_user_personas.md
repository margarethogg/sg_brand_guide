# Shiftgig User Personas

Shiftgig’s design team uses _user personas_ to guide us in the products we build and the user and business problems we set out to solve.

## What’s a user persona?

* Personas are fictional characters based on real user research
* Built on common themes repeated in user interviews and research
* A tool for fostering empathy between an organization and its user base
* Should encompass human stories, should feel like real people
* There are primary, secondary, and peripheral personas to identify different user segments and targets
* Personas are often shared across an organization in the form of printouts, documents, graphics to remind organization members who they’re designing for and delivering service to

## Our personas

Shiftgig’s design team utilizes both Specialist personas and client personas

_Specialist persona - primary_

_Specialist persona - secondary_

_Client persona - retail warehouse_

How we built our personas?

### Specialist personas

We crafted our Specialist personas from anthropological contextual interviews with Specialists. Over the course of one day, we sat down with 15 Specialists from our Chicago market and asked them a list of about 15 questions pertaining to their personal and work lives and their experience with Shiftgig. From these interviews we were able to discover overlapping trends in our user base and able to distill them down into a primary and secondary persona. We have future plans to interview Specialists in other cities to capture even more of our users’ stories.

### Client personas

Technically, our client personas are what you call _proto-personas._ Proto-personas are not built from a high volume of in-person contextual interviews, but are based on market research, competitive analyses, deep dive into industry practices, internal knowledge and documentation. We certainly built our client personas using all of the above methods, but we were also fortunate to incorporate information and questions from actual in-person client meetings, in addition to information provided by stakeholder meetings with clients. Currently, we have one client persona and it is more future-looking and was specifically focused on retail-warehouse clients (imagine clients ordering workers to staff Amazon, Target, Wal-Mart distribution centers). We have plans to build personas for our legacy clients (restaurants and catering, hospitality, and experiential marketing).
