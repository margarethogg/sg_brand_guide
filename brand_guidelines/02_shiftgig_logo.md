Our iconic revolution mark and the Shiftgig name represent a new perspective on how everyday people work and how businesses hire. The revolution anchors our name, creating a balanced and complementary relationship. The agile quality of our typeface reinforces the qualities of our symbol, our process, and our approach to business.

##Logo Usage

###Clear Space

Giving our logo room to breathe allows it to separate itself from the content so our identity remains clear and uncluttered. The rule of thumb to follow is to use the width of our revolution symbol as a unit of measure for the space needed.

###Shiftgig Green & Grey

The full color Shiftgig green & gray is our primary representation of our brand. This version should be placed on white or one of our light gray colored backgrounds (#F9F9F9, #E2E2E2). The green & gray color logo should never be used on any of the dark or saturated colors in our palette. 

When production or application needs require the logo to appear on a dark background, the green & white logo should be used. Shiftgig dark gray is the preferred background color for this treatment.

For saturated or busy photo backgrounds, a solid white version of the logo may be used. Make sure that the logo maintains accurate legibility and contrast against the background at all times.

###Black & White

The solid black or white version of the logo is reserved for use in grayscale applications. Always maintain sufficient contrast in order to preserve legibility of the logo.

###Correct Usage

Our logo should always be used a consistent manner. Deviating from the established colors and proportions should never be done unless you are setting the logo in all black or white. Any modification of the logo confuses its meaning and diminishes its impact.
