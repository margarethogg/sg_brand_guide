#COLOR FIELDS

An unexpected element to our brand is the use of angles within our layouts. Angled color fields emphasize movement and drive our audience through the content of our pages. A slice of one of our [brand gradients](brand_guidelines/03_color.md#gradients) can be used to call out a testimonial or specialist image and energize the viewer.

Angles are also used to separate content within our layouts. Standard angles include 4˚, 8˚, and 16˚, but some variation is allowed. Dense text should not be used over colorful gradient fields. When starting a new copy-heavy section use White, Light Gray, or one of our more neutral brand colors.

#PATTERNS

The Shiftgig Revolution mark can be used as a pattern to provide texture to layouts that would otherwise fall flat. Textural patterns should be subtle, so as not to distract or take away from content placed over them. Do not distort or flip the revolution mark in patterns. Refer to the [Resources](resources/01_resources.md) section of this guide for downloadable Illustrator and Sketch files containing usable textural patterns.
