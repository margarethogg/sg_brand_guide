Our iconic revolution mark and the Shiftgig name represent a new perspective on how everyday people work and how businesses hire. The revolution anchors our name, creating a balanced and complementary relationship. To download versions of our logo for print and general use, visit the [resources](/content/resources/01_resources.html) section of the guide.

Shiftgig Revolution Green has been specially selected as the defining color of our mark and our identity. To ensure proper reproduction of our logo, refer to our [color specifications](/content/brand_guidelines/07_color.html).
   
##LOGO USAGE

###Clear Space

Giving our logo room to breathe allows it to separate itself from content so our identity remains clear and uncluttered. A good rule of thumb to follow is to use the width of our revolution symbol as a unit of measure for the space needed.

###Shiftgig Green & Gray

The full color Shiftgig green and gray logo is the primary representation of our brand. Place this version on white or one of our light gray colored backgrounds #F9F9F9, #EDEDED. The green and gray color logo should never be used on any of the dark or saturated colors in our palette. 

When production needs require the logo to appear on a dark background, the green and white logo should be used. Shiftgig dark gray is the preferred background color for this treatment.

For saturated or busy photo backgrounds, use the solid white version of our logo. Make sure that all parts of the logo maintain legibility and contrast against the background at all times.

###Black & White

The solid black or white versions of the logo are reserved for use in grayscale applications. Always maintain contrast in order to preserve legibility of the logo.

##INCORRECT USAGE

Our logo should always be used a consistent manner. Never deviate from the established colors and proportions above. Any modification of the logo confuses its meaning and diminishes its impact.
