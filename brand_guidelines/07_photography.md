#PHOTOGRAPHY

Photography is a universal way of communicating a story beyond words; it is a key part of our visual system. 

Our photography should feel approachable and friendly. As a basic rule, people should be the main focus of the photograph. In addition, they should always look natural rather than staged. Photographs should feel like a documentation of something real, rather than of actors against an artificial backdrop.

##IMAGES IN CONTEXT

Photography must be carefully selected and appropriately treated in order to ensure legibility of text laid over it. Photos with too much detail can cause legibility issues.

When touch-ups need to be applied to an image, make sure that it does not look artificial. Touching up photos is a subjective process. Adjusting the saturation and levels of the imagery is often necessary to maintain a consistently vibrant look to our photographs. Over saturation however, can create an artificial look and should be avoided. Keep in mind the soft but bright look of our color palette and illustrative style.

##FINDING THE RIGHT TONE

When selecting images, it is important to consider the tone and feeling of the image. It should avoid cliches and instead feel unexpected. Generic and staged images should be avoided. The viewer should always be delighted and engaged with the photograph, evoking a feeling of inspiration and excitement.

When choosing photos to represent our Specialists and verticals, look for candid and natural shots. Testimonial Imagery can be face-on and direct. When possible, choose photographs with a diffuse or upper right light source, to match our brand gradients and illustrations.

##PERFECTING PHOTOGRAPHS

When dealing with photographs that seem flat or dull in tone, adjusting the levels and bumping up the contrast can be helpful. The final image should feel refined and pop off the screen.

###A Note Cbout Cropping

Cropping can drastically change the tone of an image. When cropping, take care to make sure that the focal point is visible when placed within your layout. While working with responsive layouts, make sure your focal point doesn't shift out of view when a layout is resized or viewed on another device. Avoid centered focal points, as they are challenging and unfriendly to the viewer. Follow the rule of thirds to create balanced compositions.
