We have a custom set of icons for all our front-end applications. They are used across iOS, Android, and our web platform. We are continuing to grow our custom icon library.

#Icon Creation Rules

###Geometric vs. Organic
Whenever possible, create icons using simple geometric shapes. This approach helps to create a sturdy collection of icons and reinforces consistency and rhythm with our illustrations and UI elements.

###Simple vs. Detailed
Reduced icons to their most simplified form that still allows for effective communication. Icons should not be heavy or require decoding by the user. They should be immediately intuitive.

###Flat vs. Dimensional
In keeping with our simplified approach to illustration, icons should never be skeuomorphic. They should remain minimal to keep consistency to the design and feel of the site.

##Sizing & Proportions

Icons within mobile platforms should follow the best practices within the platform.
