We have a custom set of icons for all our front-end applications. They are used across iOS, Android, and our web platforms. We are continuing to grow our custom icon library every day. To request access to the library, please contact [design@shiftgig.com](mailto:design@shiftgig.com).

Our icons, like much of our brand, are simple and geometric. They are created with light lines, open shapes, and hard edges. To tie our icons in with our illustrative approach and soft color palette, most include an outer circle. Outline circles indicate information, while solid circles are intended to be actionable icons. 

While our icons are used across all platforms, we've adjusted line weights between our Android & iOS icons to complement each native environment. In some cases the circles may be removed from an icon in order to incorporate it within standard elements on each platform.

Or color messaging system should be applied to icons in order to convey extra meaning to our users. For color messaging details, visit our [color specifications](/content/brand_guidelines/05_color.html)

##Icon Creation Guidelines

###Geometric vs. Organic
Whenever possible, create icons using simple geometric shapes. This approach creates a sturdy collection of icons and reinforces consistency and rhythm with our illustrations, layouts, and UI elements.

###Simple vs. Detailed
Reduce icons to their most simplified form that still allows for effective communication. Icons should not be heavy or require decrypting by the user. They should be immediately intuitive.

###Flat vs. Dimensional
In keeping with our simplified approach to illustration, icons should never be dimensional. They should remain minimal to keep consistency to the design and feel of the site.

##Sizing & Proportions

Icons within mobile platforms should follow the best practices within the platform. Inline icons on the web should match the height of the text they accompany. In most other circumstances, icons should be restricted to a size of 44px x 44px or below.
