# OUR BRAND

The brand must be easy to read and understand, express expertise, and speak in an inclusive and relevant tone. It is important to convey our brand in this manner across all user touch points  so that when our varying audiences hear or read our message, they know it’s from Shiftgig — a brand that embodies trust, integrity, optimism, compassion, and pride in helping others achieve their goals. These feelings define the way we hope to be perceived: supportive, inspiring, authentic, and value driven.
