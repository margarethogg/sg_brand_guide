We've built a library of illustrations in a style that complements our clean, contemporary, and friendly brand. Our use of color and visual rhythm ties our illustrations together across our entire library.

##ILLUSTRATION CREATION RULES

###Geometric

<section class="images two-up example">
	<article>
		<img src="/assets/images/shiftgig_illustration_asset_thumbs-1.png">
		<caption class="do">Geographic shapes.</caption>
	</article>
	<article>
		<img src="/assets/images/shiftgig_illustration_asset_thumbs-2.png">
		<caption class="do-not">Too freeform and curvy.</caption>
	</article>
</section>

Build illustrations using simple geometric shapes combined with rounded corners. The use of circles, squares, and simple forms as the basis for our illustrations sets up a rhythm that ties our visual language together. Prefer lines that fall at 45ยบ and 90ยบ to randomly chosen angles and curves.

###Iconic

<section class="images two-up example">
	<article>
		<img src="/assets/images/shiftgig_illustration_asset_earth.png">
		<caption class="do">Simple and abstract.</caption>
	</article>
	<article>
		<img src="/assets/images/shiftgig_illustration_asset_earth_2.png">
		<caption class="do-not">Too much line detail.</caption>
	</article>
</section>

Reduce illustrations to their most simple forms and universal meanings. Abstracting images makes them accessible to a wider audience. Larger and more complex illustrations can be further reduced into icons for use in small spaces, or where the content should be highlighted rather than the image.

###Flat

<section class="images two-up example">
	<article>
		<img src="/assets/images/shiftgig_illustration_asset_clock.png">
		<caption class="do">Flat and iconic.</caption>
	</article>
	<article>
		<img src="/assets/images/shiftgig_illustration_asset_clock_2.png">
		<caption class="do-not">Too much texture and dimension.</caption>
	</article>
</section>

Our illustrations feature clean lines, open forms, crisp edges, and a lack of dimension. Flat design offers a simplified, classical aesthetic. Avoid creating overly detailed, textured or photo-realistic images.

###Bright

		<caption class="do">Good colors.</caption>
	</article>
	<article>
        <img src="/assets/images/shiftgig_illustration_asset_icecream_2.png">
		<caption class="do-not">Too saturated and high contrast.</caption>
	</article>
	<article>
        <img src="/assets/images/shiftgig_illustration_asset_icecream_3.png">
		<caption class="do-not">Too desaturated.</caption>

Our brand illustrations are bright but not garish. For a palette based on our brand colors, please refer to the [Resources](resources/01_resources.md) section of this guide.

##ILLUSTRATION DOS & DON'TS

* Do use geometric forms and rounded corners to create illustrations.
* Do add flattened drop shadows or dimension to illustration as needed.
* Do not add gradients, soft drop shadows, textures or painterly brush strokes to illustrations
* Do treat images as flat elements and, if dimension is needed, apply one shadow at 0ยบ or 8ยบ that falls across the entire image.
* Do use soft, bright colors that complement Shiftgig's brand colors.
* Do not add overly saturated, dark, or garish colors.
* Do maintain good contrast within illustrations. If possible, check that they still read when converted to grayscale.
* Do not create images that are overly cartoony, dated, or "clip art" styled.
* Do create images as vectors that can be reproduced at different sizes and used for both digital and print applications.
