We've built a library of illustrations in a style that complements our clean, contemporary, and friendly brand. Our brand voice is friendly and edgy, and our illustrations should reflect the same tone. Our use of color and visual rhythm ties our illustrations together across our entire library.

##ILLUSTRATION CREATION RULES

###Geometric

<section class="example">
	<article>

		<img src="">
	</article>
</section>

Build illustrations using simple geometric shapes combined with rounded corners. The use of circles, squares, and simple forms as the basis for our illustrations sets up a rhythm that ties our visual language together. Prefer lines that fall at 45ยบ and 90ยบ to randomly chosen angles and curves.

###Iconic

</section>

Reduce illustrations to their most simple forms and universal meanings. Abstracting images makes them accessible to a wider audience. Avoid creating overly detailed, textured or photo-realistic images.

###Flat

</section>

Our illustrations feature clean, open space, crisp edges, bright colors, and are two-dimensional. Flat design offers a more simplified, classical aesthetic. Larger, more complex illustrations can be further reduced into icons for use in small spaces, or where the content should be highlighted rather than the image.

###Bright

</section>

Our brand is bright and edgy, and our illustrations are as well. For a palette based on our brand colors, please refer to the [Resources](resources/01_resources.md) section of this guide. 

###Dynamic

When possible, add movement to illustrations in order to add interest and catch the eye of the viewer.

##ILLUSTRATION DOS & DON'TS

* Do use geometric forms and rounded corners to create illustrations.
* Do add flattened drop shadows or dimension to illustration as needed.
* Do not add gradients, soft drop shadows, textures or painterly brush strokes to illustrations
* Do treat images as flat elements and, if dimension is needed, apply one shadow at 0ยบ or 8ยบ that falls across the entire image.
* Do use soft, bright colors that complement Shiftgig's brand colors.
* Do not add overly saturated, dark, or garish colors.
* Do maintain good contrast within illustrations. If possible, check that they still read when converted to grayscale.
* Do not create images that are overly cartoony, dated, or "clip art" styled.
* Do create images as vectors that can be reproduced at different sizes and used for both digital and print applications.
