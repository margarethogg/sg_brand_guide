# LANGUAGE & TONE


Shiftgig is a contemporary and edgy brand. We use concise action driven language that has a splash of slang to it, giving it an accessible and human tone.

### Audience
We're taking a disruptive stance in the staffing space, one that speaks to revolutionizing things in order to become a go-to for our audience. This is a unique audience, those who choose to do shift work over a 9 to 5. They more often than not crave experiences, variety, flexibility, and not being tied down. These individuals identify as being part of the “gig economy.” We want to make them feel special and assure them that we know the ins and outs of this arena.

### Recommendation
Strike a balance between functional information and emotional motivation. Like Dollar Shave Club: Clearly communicates, but in a way that’s entertaining, true to concept, and full of personality.

Respect our audience. Know why they come to the site, what they want, and how to get it to them quickly.

Be encouraging at every turn. Boost their confidence that our service, over others, helps them lead the life they want.

Always tip the balance towards them, not us.

Let’s not forget some fun and wit.

### Segmentation

Since it’s a service, those we’re helping are less “customers” than they are users. “Workers” sounds like you belong in a factory.

I prefer to think of all sides as variants of “specialists.” Businesses trying to be smart and succeed. Workers who choose this lifestyle and have committed to it.
