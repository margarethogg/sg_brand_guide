##Logo Usage

###Shiftgig Green & Grey

When possible, the full color Shiftgig green & gray version should always be used and placed on white or one of our light gray colored backgrounds (#F9F9F9, #E2E2E2).

The green & gray color logo should never be used on any of the dark or tertiary colors in the palette. The green & white logo are reserved for dark backgrounds.

Shiftgig Revolution Green has been specially selected as the defining color of our identity. To ensure proper reproduction of our logo, refer to the color specifications and rule.

When production or application needs require the logo to appear on a dark or colored background, a reversed version of the logo may be used. A white logo, knocked out of Shiftgig dark gray is the preferred treatment.

###Black & White

When color reproduction is unavailable, a black or white version of the logo may be used. Always maintain sufficient contrast in order to preserve legibility of the logo..

##Logo Spacing

###Clear Space

Clear space frames the logo, separating it from other elements such as headlines, text, imagery and the outside edges of printed materials. A minimum amount of clear space must surround the logo at all times.
 
###Minimum Size

Do not reproduce the preferred logo smaller than 32 pixels in height. Do not reproduce the small - reproduction logo smaller than 16 pixels in height
