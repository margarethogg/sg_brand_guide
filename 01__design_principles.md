#01 / DESIGN PRINCIPLES
These five principles are a guide for the Shiftgig 2.0 design direction, and help set the vision/approach for all Shiftgig digital touchpoints.

###Impactful
With a bold, vibrant perspective on what on-demand staffing experience can be, our design feels aspirational and expansive, shifting our customers' expectations and positioning ourselves as a leader in the industry.

###Approachable
Simple shapes and forms combined with a clean grid system, create an open, airy aesthetic to make even the most content-rich areas approachable and manageable for users around the world.

###Edgy
Content on Shiftgig's digital channels is displayed in a clear, organized but fun and playful manor, allowing the user to easily digest information and connect to the information that is most important to them.

###Functional
A carefully considered user experience allows users of all types to easily and efficiently navigate through the journey across all our digital touchpoints.

###Scalable
We are designing for the now while keeping a keen eye on the future. Our design is intended to adapt to additional channels and technology along with the unique needs of our Specialists & Clients.
