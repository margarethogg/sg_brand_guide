#00 / INTRODUCTION

## SHIFTGIG IS CHANGING THE WAY PEOPLE WORK.

Founded on the simple premise that many people want flexible work opportunities that fit into the rest of their lives, we build technology that is focused on one thing: connecting people who want temporary work right now with businesses who need them. Our apps make it easy for businesses to post gigs and for qualified and skilled workers to claim them. Our platform helps with event management, and handles all the messy bits in between. 

We believe everyone benefits when people are empowered to work the way they want to work.
