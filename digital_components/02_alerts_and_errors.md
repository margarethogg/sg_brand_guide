#ALERTS & ERRORS

Alerts are a way to provide valuable and relevant feedback to users. An error message alerts users of a problem that has already occurred, while a warning message informs users of a condition that might cause a problem in the future.

##FLASHES / SYSTEM ALERTS

Flashes and System Alerts are notices and error messages that occur at the top of a page or screen and pertain to that screen.

<section class="example">
	<article>
		<div class="flash-notice">
			<strong>This is a Notice.</strong> I might contain a caveat or a helpful tip.
		</div>
		<div class="flash-alert">
			<strong>Look at me!</strong> I have something important to say!
		</div>
		<div class="flash-error">
			<strong>Oh Noes!</strong> Something went wrong. It's probably Brad's fault.
		</div>
		<div class="flash-success">
			<strong>Success!</strong> You did something that worked as expected. Here's what happened.
		</div>
	</article>
</section>

Messages should be accompanied by their corresponding color to show level of importance. There should never be more than two lines of text for either the headline or the information that follows. This will make sure the user stays engaged and is informed with important information that pertains to their selections.

##INLINE ALERTS

Inline Alerts occur contextually within the page and pertain to a particular item or section as opposed to the entire pageâ€™s content. These messages are generally used for form validation and should show up in red or green text directly below a form element.
