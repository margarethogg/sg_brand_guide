By setting up grid templates and spacing guidelines, we promote consistency with a defined structure throughout our design. Grids ground content in a logical way, establishing a clear layout for all pages across the site.

The main idea behind the grid-based design, is to have a structured, well balanced, and solid visual aspect to the site layout. Sophisticated layout structures o er more flexibility and enhance the visual experience for the user. Grid systems create a cleaner more organized design, which users can easily follow the content of the page.
