#GRIDS & KEY LINES

By setting up grid templates and spacing guidelines, we promote consistency with a defined structure throughout our design. Grids ground content in a logical way, establishing a clear layout for all pages across the site.

The main idea behind grid-based design is to have a structured, well-balanced, and solid visual aspect to our site layout. Sophisticated layout structures offer more flexibility and enhance the visual experience for the user. Grid systems create a cleaner more organized design, within which users can easily follow the content of the page.
