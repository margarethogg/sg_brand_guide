##Primary Button Hierarchy

Sometimes it is necessary to give the user multiple options at a step in the path. In these cases, the preferred action should be given prominence by placing it on top in cases of stacked actions or on the right when actions are placed side by side. Right hand buttons should give the option to move forward with or accept an action, while left hand buttons are reserved for canceling or moving backwards within a flow.

##Primary & Secondary Actions – Stacked

Alternate Action button becomes Secondary when the user is presented with 3 options and should only be used in rare instances when complex hierarchy and visual balance is necessary on a page.

Sometimes it is necessary to give the user multiple options at a step in the path. In these cases, the preferred choice (action) should be given prominence by using the gold button and placing it on top or on the right. The secondary action (gray) should be placed on bottom or to the left.

In rare cases where there are three actions available, the Alternate Action (blue) button may be introduced.

##Secondary Buttons

Secondary buttons should always be used as action buttons when making selections within a specific section of the page, modal or light box, when there is limited real estate. These buttons should be a minimum width of 140 px and have a maximum height of 30 px. The buttons on this page represent the standard size, but in cases where the text within does not fit, allow for 20 px of clear space on either side.

Hover states are a single, solid hex and are based on the top hex of the button gradient.
Throughout the site, we have chosen to use the modern gold gradient as our primary action button color. This was done in order to draw more attention to the desired selection, and to guide the user through the process with more ease and clarity.

If there are two actions available, the secondary button will be the light gray gradient. In rare cases where there are three actions available, the Alternate Action (blue) button may be introduced.

The width of the buttons will differ due to the number of selections. There should always be a 2 pixel gutter between each of the buttons.

When there is a secondary button on a color gradient, the size of the button remains consistent. The color on the other hand is a specific gradient only to be used in these cases, and no where else in the site.

##Ancillary Buttons

Ancillary buttons are the call to action used within ads and offers throughout shiftgig.com and third party vending. These buttons should be a minimum width of 200 px and have a maximum height of 22 px. The buttons on this page represent the standard size, but in cases where the text within does not fit, allow for 20 px of clear space on either side.

##Button Do’s & Don’ts

When there is a multiple selection scenario, it is important to be very clear on the primary and secondary actions. We should guide the user through the selection process with as much ease as possible and help them get to their desired means.

#Alerts & Errors

Messages are a way to provide valuable and relevant feedback to users. An error message alerts users of a problem that has already occurred, while a warning message alerts users of a condition that might cause a problem in the future. Our messaging
is designed to clearly inform our users by providing graphical and textual indicators that are readable and descriptive to support our belief in transparency.
          
##System Alerts

System Alerts occur at the top of the page and pertain to information reflected on that particular page.

The body copy is the main text found throughout the site which informs our travelers on all the services and information related to their travel. In most instances the body copy will be between 14pt and 10pt depending on page placement and in order of importance of information. Body copy of 12pt and smaller should always be regular and not light for legibility.

##Multiple System Alerts (stacked)
System Alerts occur at the top of the page and pertain to information reflected on that particular page.

In most instances the body copy will be between 14pt and 10pt depending on page placement and in order of importance of information. Body copy of 12pt and smaller should always be regular and not light for legibility.

##Error Messaging

System maintenance errors will be the  first thing a user sees whenever they enter the site. These messages are top the page, and let the user know when there are site wide errors or updates taking place to better improve the user experience. Maintenance errors use a cautionary marking with the modern gold  ll. This is the only place on the site this treatment will be used.

##Critical Error and Warning message

If there happens to be two different types of messages presented to the user, the critical should always be listed  first. In this case, both messages should be accompanied by their corresponding icon to show level of importance. If there are two current messages of the same level of importance, only one icon is needed for both. There should never be more than two lines of text for either the headline or the information that follows. This will make sure the user stays engaged and is informed with important information that pertains to their selections.

##Inline Alerts

Inline Alerts occur contextually within the page and pertain to a particular item or section as opposed to the entire page’s content.

Headline copy is either 16pt or 10pt depending on location in page and order of hierarchy structure or importance. Body copy will be between 14pt and 10pt and also depend on page placement and order of importance of information. Body copy of 12pt and smaller should always be regular, not light, for legibility.

##Color Messaging

A Red alert signifies the most severe condition with significant impact on travel. An Orange alert denotes a moderate risk with potential impact on travel.

#Hinting

Tooltips are messages specifically set to show a user when there has been a mistake in data entry, or more data is needed to proceed in the selection process. Tooltip error modals will have an error red (CD202C) one pixel stroke with a white (FFFFFF) fill. The type call outs of what is needed will be 12pt, medium gray (666666) and have a 14pt line spacing. See illustrations for rules and container spacing.

#Grids & Spacing

By setting up grid templates and spacing guidelines, we promote consistency with a defined structure throughout our design. Grids ground content in a logical way, establishing a clear layout for all pages across the site.

##Sitewide Grid

The main idea behind the grid-based design, is to have a structured, well balanced, and solid visual aspect to the site layout. Sophisticated layout structures o er more flexibility and enhance the visual experience for the user. Grid systems create a cleaner more organized design, which users can easily follow the content of the page.
