##Button Hierarchy

Sometimes it is necessary to give the user multiple options at a step in the path. In these cases, the preferred action should be given prominence by placing it on top in cases of stacked actions or on the right when actions are placed side by side. Right hand buttons should give the option to move forward with or accept an action, while left hand buttons are reserved for canceling or moving backwards within a flow.

In rare cases where there are three actions available, the Alternate Action (blue) button may be introduced. In these cases the third action should be presented below the preferred actions, and deemphasized using our secondary, hollow button styles.

Secondary button styles may also be used to deemphasize buttons that would otherwise overpower or distract from the main content of a page or screen.

#Alerts & Errors

Messages are a way to provide valuable and relevant feedback to users. An error message alerts users of a problem that has already occurred, while a warning message alerts users of a condition that might cause a problem in the future. Our messaging
is designed to clearly inform our users by providing graphical and textual indicators that are readable and descriptive to support our belief in transparency.

##Color Messaging

Shiftgig maintains a strong use of color messaging across all platforms. Our primary colors each have a distinct meaning.

##Flashes / System Alerts

Flashes and System Alerts are notices, error messages, etc that occur at the top of a page or screen and pertain to information reflected on that particular page.

This is a Notice. I might contain a caveat or a helpful tip.
Look at me! I have something important to say!
Oh Noes! Something went wrong. It's probably Brad's fault.
Success! You did something that worked as expected–here's what happened.

Messages should be accompanied by their corresponding color to show level of importance. There should never be more than two lines of text for either the headline or the information that follows. This will make sure the user stays engaged and is informed with important information that pertains to their selections.

##Inline Alerts

Inline Alerts occur contextually within the page and pertain to a particular item or section as opposed to the entire page’s content. These messages are generally used for form validation, and should show up in red or green text directly below a form element.

##Hinting

Tooltips are messages specifically set to show more data relating to a selection or to provide context for a piece of information when page space is limited.

#Grids & Spacing

By setting up grid templates and spacing guidelines, we promote consistency with a defined structure throughout our design. Grids ground content in a logical way, establishing a clear layout for all pages across the site.

The main idea behind the grid-based design, is to have a structured, well balanced, and solid visual aspect to the site layout. Sophisticated layout structures o er more flexibility and enhance the visual experience for the user. Grid systems create a cleaner more organized design, which users can easily follow the content of the page.
