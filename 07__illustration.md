#07.0 / Illustration

We've built a library of illustrations in a style that complements our brand colors and our clean, friendly, and open design language. Our brand voice is friendly and conversational, and our imagery should reflect the same tone. Our use of color and rhythm ties our illustration together across our full library

#07.2 / Illustration Creation Rules

###Geometric vs. Organic
Build illustrations using simple geometric shapes combined with rounded corners. The use of circles, squares, and simple forms as the basis for our illustrations sets up a rhythm that ties our complete library together. Prefer lines that fall at 45ยบ and 90ยบ to randomly chosen angles and curves.

###Iconic vs. Representational
Reduce illustrations to their most simple forms and universal meanings. Abstracting images makes them relatable to a wider audience. Avoid creating overly detailed or photo-realistic images.

###Flat vs. Dimensional
Following styles set forth by iOS 7 and Material Design, avoid dimensional shadows and skeumorphism in favor of flat, iconic imagery. 

###Diverse vs monotone
Our Specialists, cities and shifts are incredibly diverse, and our brand should reflect that. As when selecting stock photography, avoid defaulting to one platform, gender, or race when creating illustrations. If possible, create variations that can be randomized or used throughout different applications.

###Dynamic vs. Static
When possible, add movement to illustrations in order to add interest and catch the eye of the viewer.

#07.3 / Illustration Dos & Don'ts

* Do use geometric forms and rounded corners to create illustrations.
* Do add flattened drop shadows or dimension to illustration as needed.
* Do not add gradients, soft drop shadows, textures or painterly brush strokes to illustrations
* Do treat images as flat elements and, if dimension is needed, apply one shadow at 0ยบ-8ยบ that spans the entire image.
* Do use soft, bright colors that complement Shiftgig's brand colors. For an available illustration palette, visit the resources section.
* Do not add overly saturated, dark, or garish colors.
* Do maintain good contrast within illustrations. If possible, check if they still read when converted to grayscale.
* Do not create images that are overly cartoonish, dated, or "clipart" styled.
* Do create images as vectors that can be reproduced at several sizes and used for both digital and print applications.
