#06.2 / Illustration Creation Rules

###Geometric vs. Organic
Whenever possible, Illustrations should be created using simple geometric shapes. This approach helps to create a sturdy collection of Illustrations and reinforces consistency.

###Simplifed vs. Detailed
Illustrations should be reduced down to their most simplified form that still allows for effective communication. This includes eliminating any type of perspective to maintain a  at form.

###Straight Line vs. Rounded
With the exception of circles, all edges should be hard rather than soft. Hard edges convey straightforwardness and when used consistently, help to create a cohesive system. In certain cases this rule can be bent but only when a soft edge is crucial to the communication of the Illustration.

###Flat vs. Dimensional
In keeping with the simplified, approach, Illustrations should never appear to have dimension, shadows or gradients. They should remain  at and minimal to keep consistency to the overall design and feel of the site.
