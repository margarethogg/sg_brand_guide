#05.0 / Photography

The new Homepage is a powerful design that allows us to instantly set a mood, communicate relevant destinations, and inspire our customers to travel.

A well-curated photography library for the Homepage keeps the site looking fresh and exciting. While our focus is on the homepage module layout, the styles we outline here can be applied to other channels and interior pages.

#05.1 / Brand Photography

Photography is a universal way of communicating a story beyond words; it is a key part of our visual system. Through our distinct journey style, we welcome our viewers to “walk in” and occupy the image space, creating a unique experience for all our materials. We should best represent the variety and quality of products by reflecting the positive emotional benefit that is associated with each service.

#05.2 / Images in Context
When selecting images, it is important to consider the layout of the homepage and select images carefully to work within the layout. These guidelines will help in selecting imagery that will work compositionally in our homepage.

##Dos & Don'ts

Photography must be carefully selected and/or appropriately treated in order to ensure legibility of the main navigation. Photos with too much detail also can cause legibility issues with the navigation and should be avoided.

When a gradient or any other touch-up needs to be applied to an image, make sure that it does not look artificial. Touching up photos with gradients is a subjective process, but a general rule is that the gradient should pull from the color palette of the image to avoid looking fake
or overly treated.

Our photography should feel vibrant and exciting, not washed out and gray. Adjusting the saturation and levels of the imagery is often necessary to maintain a consistently vibrant look to our photographs. Over saturation however, can create an artificial look and should be avoided.

Photographs with a lot of density and detail can be an exciting addition to the photography portfolio, but they must meet very specific criteria to work with the layout of the homepage. Be careful that the detail doesn't become visually overwhelming or obscure the main navigation. Finding images with the right contrast, and an even density will result in a textural, rather than distracting image.

##Finding the right tone

When selecting images, it is important to consider the tone and feeling of the image. A perfect image should feel aspirational, making the viewer excited about the location. It should avoid cliches and instead rely on more subtle visual cues as to its location. Generic and staged images should be avoided. The viewer should always be delighted and engaged with the photograph, evoking a feeling of inspiration and excitement.

Natural vs. Staged
Unexpected vs. Cliche
Specific vs. Generic
Aspirational vs. Unappealing

The images on the homepage should make the viewer mentally place themselves in it with excitement. Images should be a romantic and enticing, yet realistic, representation of a location.

As a basic rule, people should never be the main focus of the photograph. If people do appear, it should always be secondary to the location and not overwhelm the frame. In addition, they should always look natural rather than staged. The photograph should feel like a documentation of something real rather than people posing for a photograph.

Our photography should avoid cliches, instead relying on more subtle visual cues to indicate the location of the photograph. An image that finds the sweet spot between unexpected and recognizable is ideal.

In general, our images should be selected because they evoke the feeling of a specific place. Generic images that look like they could be depicting any number of places should be avoided.

#05.3 / Photography Refinements

##Perfecting Photographs

When selecting images, it is important to consider the tone and feeling of the image. A perfect image should feel aspirational, making the viewer excited about the location. It should avoid cliches and instead rely on more subtle visual cues as to its location. Generic and staged images should be avoided. The viewer should always be delighted and engaged with the photograph, evoking a feeling of inspiration and excitement.

###Adding a Gradient

To ensure legibility in the main navigation, it is often necessary to add a gradient to the top and/or bottom of the image. The gradient should never look like it was added on top of the image, but is rather a part of it. Using colors that are taken directly from the colors in the image is recommended. If there is visual detail under the gradient, it can often look artificial and more detailed editing of the gradient may be necessary.

###Adding Saturation

To avoid washed out or dull images, it is often necessary to add saturation to liven them up. However, an over saturated image may result in an unnatural look, so always strive for a balanced and natural look.

###Adjusting Levels

When dealing with photographs that seem flat or dull in tone, adjusting the levels and bumping up the contrast can be helpful. The final image should feel refined and pop off the screen.

###Cropping Appropriately

Cropping can drastically change the tone of an image. When cropping, take care to make sure that the focal point is visible when placed with the modules. Avoiding centered focal points and following the rule of thirds is also advised.

#05.4 / Hero Imagery

When selecting photography for the home page of shiftgig.com, the image should have a minimum width of 1920 pixels, and a minimum height of 1200 pixels. The fixed size for imagery will provide a consistent background for all viewing ports a user could be using to interact with the site. With the strategic design of the interactive elements of the home page being centered and locked, the background image size allows for a fluid transfer between screen and device sizes.

The background image will have a center fixed position in the viewing screen. The site content will overlay the background and be centered no matter the size of the view port.
