#05.0 / Photography

A well-curated photography library keeps our brand looking fresh and exciting.

#05.1 / Brand Photography

Photography is a universal way of communicating a story beyond words; it is a key part of our visual system. 

#05.2 / Images in Context
When selecting images, it is important to consider layout and select images carefully to work within the layout. These guidelines will help in selecting imagery that will work compositionally.

##Dos & Don'ts

Photography must be carefully selected and/or appropriately treated in order to ensure legibility of text laid over it. Photos with too much detail can cause legibility issues.

When touch-up needs to be applied to an image, make sure that it does not look artificial. Touching up photos is a subjective process. Adjusting the saturation and levels of the imagery is often necessary to maintain a consistently vibrant look to our photographs. Over saturation however, can create an artificial look and should be avoided. 

Our photography should feel approachable and friendly.

Photographs with a lot of density and detail can be an exciting addition to the photography portfolio. Be careful that the detail doesn't become visually overwhelming. Finding images with the right contrast, and an even density will result in a textural, rather than distracting image.

##Finding the right tone

When selecting images, it is important to consider the tone and feeling of the image. It should avoid cliches and instead . Generic and staged images should be avoided. The viewer should always be delighted and engaged with the photograph, evoking a feeling of inspiration and excitement.

###Natural vs. Staged
###Unexpected vs. Cliche
###Specific vs. Generic
###Diverse vs. Monotonous

As a basic rule, people should be the main focus of the photograph. In addition, they should always look natural rather than staged. The photograph should feel like a documentation of something real rather than people posing for a photograph.

Our photography should avoid cliches, instead relying on more subtle visual cues to indicate the location of the photograph. An image that finds the sweet spot between unexpected and recognizable is ideal.

#05.3 / Photography Refinements

##Perfecting Photographs

###Adding Saturation

To avoid washed out or dull images, it is often necessary to add saturation to liven them up. However, an over saturated image may result in an unnatural look, so always strive for a balanced and natural look.

###Adjusting Levels

When dealing with photographs that seem flat or dull in tone, adjusting the levels and bumping up the contrast can be helpful. The final image should feel refined and pop off the screen.

###Cropping Appropriately

Cropping can drastically change the tone of an image. When cropping, take care to make sure that the focal point is visible when placed with the modules. Avoiding centered focal points and following the rule of thirds is also advised.
